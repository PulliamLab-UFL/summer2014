# Lab exercises for Summer 2014

### For 27 June

Read and discuss:

> Dushoff, J, Plotkin, JB, Levin, SA, & Earn, DJD. (2004). Dynamical resonance can account for seasonality of influenza epidemics. _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America_, 101(48), 16915â€“6. [doi:10.1073/pnas.0407293101](http://www.pnas.org/content/101/48/16915.full)

### For 3 July

Code the deterministic model in Dushoff et al. 2004. If you want to do this in anything other than R, you're on your own. If you'll be using R, here are some resources to help you get started:

- Complete the [R Studio tutorial and R tutorials 1-3](http://lalashan.mcmaster.ca/theobio/mmed/index.php/Introduction_to_R), if you haven't already done this and are unfamiliar with either of these programs (or if you need a refresher).
- Complete the [lab on ODE's in R](http://lalashan.mcmaster.ca/theobio/mmed/index.php/Lab_1:_ODE_models_in_R)

During the lab meeting we'll discuss issues that arose and troubleshoot each other's code, as needed. We'll also look as some of the issues we discussed today, such as what happens (with and without seasonal forcing) when you initialize at the endemic equilibrium.
